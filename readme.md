  ## Description
  This challenge was based on using node.js to generate a professional README with ease. This README you are reading now has been created using the generator.

  ## Installation
  Two packages are needed for this generator to work properly: Inquirer and badge-maker. Inquirer is used primarily for the prompted questions and bage-maker is used for creating the license badge. This can be installed using <npm i inquirer @8.2.4> and <npm i badge-maker> respectively.

  ## Usage
  This application is used to create a professional README in a clean and easy to navigate format.

  ## License
